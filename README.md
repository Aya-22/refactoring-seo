# refactoring-seo

## The main focus of this project is to refactor the code to ensure that the web page is accessible. 

The most important thing for a web page to become accessible is to make sure it has semantic HTML elements. The semantic HTML elements were achieved on this project by changing the div tags to body, header, main, footer, etc. Once the code was changed to semantic elements the CSS code was also changed to include the correct selectors. Once the CSS code matched the semantic elements on the HTML page, some of the selectors with the same elements were combined. In this project I learned how iimportant accessibility is for a web page. It makes the project more defined and less confusing to read. 

The following image shows the completed web application after applying semantic HTML:
